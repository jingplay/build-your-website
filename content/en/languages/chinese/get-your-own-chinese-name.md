Chinese names are a significant part of the individual's identity and carry a deep cultural heritage. Typically, a Chinese name consists of a single-syllable surname followed by a one or two-syllable given name. The given names are carefully selected to reflect virtues and qualities desired by the family, such as wisdom, strength, beauty, and prosperity.
